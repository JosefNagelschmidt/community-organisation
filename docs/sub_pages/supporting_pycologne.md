# Supporting PyCologne 

PyCologne is completely ran by volunteers, we all have our own reasons for choosing to donate our free time to the community and we all do so in different ways. We welcome your support and will do our best to support you.

(what-you-can-expect)=
## What you can expect

Supporting can range from one off events, regular or a series of events, handling our social media or email, donating money or resources, or something else which you believe will benefit our community. As you will do this in your free time we always recommend to think about what is sustainable for your situation, and something you will feel is beneficial to you. For example giving a workshop might help you develop your public speaking skills while facilitating one might help develop managerial or team building skills. As a member of our community you are empowered to lead it and advocate for the things you feel are important. This work can be exciting and rewarding, it will not only help you build up skills, build a network within the broader Python community but also have a huge impact on many other community members. We recognize that many of you have other commitments and may have to drop out for a while or entirely if your situation changes.

### Other ways you might support the community

However perhaps you see an opportunity we have not yet identified, we welcome ideas and suggestions. If you want to discuss them more we suggest attending our [monthly org meeting](monthly-org-meetings) which takes place on the first Thursday of the month, we post reminders including details on how you can join in our discord.

## Recognizing your work, what we can offer

While we normally can't financially compensate folks for their work we still think it's important to recognize those who make our community so awesome :sparkle: we therefore have a couple ways that we can highlight your work:

- Add your volunteer work on your CV, we think it's pretty awesome that your supporting the community- and so do employers! Incase you need a reference you can email us [here](mailto:info@jn.contact) and we will do our best to write one from our official account.
- Add your volunteer work on LinkedIn; you can add your volunteer work to PyCologne on your profile and let potential employers know that you are supporting the community. 


- *coming soon* Let us shout about you! We would love to make some noise about how you are supporting our community, we will collect some basic information so we can post on our social media platforms and show our appreciation.
- *coming soon* We are currently waiting on PyCologne T-Shirts and from time to time receive other swag which we receive for those who contribute to our community- what more of an incentive do you need? 

(monthly-org-meetings)=
## Monthly Org Meetings

We run monthly organizer meetups on the first Thursday of the month between 8pm-9pm (Berlin time). You have both the option to join in person or remotely. If you want to know how we plan events/ make decisions in the community either as purely an observer or more actively then you are welcome to join us :heart:

Sometimes we will also try offer the main session trainings or facilitated discussion sessions that might interest community members involved in organization :slightly_smiling_face:

If you want to participate on these monthly org meetings, join our discord (see [here](./about_pycologne.md) how to join) and check on the events page.

Agenda points are set [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WfIZbsNH6A-MPcC9WA5FJkMZOww2OXAH9iqo5jMpPIw/edit?usp=sharing).

We have three sections:
- **Announcement:** short announcements that require no input or a thumbs up thumbs down from the group
- **Request for help:** 5 minute slot to make your proposal and ask for help (including questions posed to you)
- **Discussion topics:** Longer topics which require more input & open discussion
