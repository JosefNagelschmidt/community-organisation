# Facilitating an event

Facilitating an event can include many different aspects of event organization. Normally at least one person is required to lead the event though ideal there are two or more people involved. Some sections will not be relevant so feel free to jump to those which are, where possible we will try guide you to get to the relevant information for your needs as quick as possible. What's important to remember when planning an event is what our community's mission is and if therefore the event you want to run is best suited to our PyCologne community or perhaps to another other group (we are open to collaborate with other groups). Secondly all events and attendees **must** abide to our [Code of Conduct](https://policies.python.org/python.org/code-of-conduct/). Apart from that, it is open for you to bring your ideas to the community. The guides below will give you examples of what has worked before as well as how to set up events on our meetup page, where to find our logos, post on our social media, handle Code of Conduct breaches, support speakers, and collect feedback.

## Who can run a event for PyCologne

In short anyone! If you have something you want to share with the community we encourage you to do so. In this guide we will provide you with resources to help you get started and we encourage you to ask for guidance and support from those who have already gone through the process, though we hope you will not be discouraged if there is not the capacity to do it with you.

## What running an event involves

First you will need to decide on when you want your event to run, our regular sessions run each month on the second Tuesday of the month but you may choose to run an event on another date. Check our [overview](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qc_b39H33XJKjB8E2fkfYpRG19JXkhICesTK4PSTGAc/edit?usp=sharing) for events to see what others are planning and also look at the [google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/3?cid=Y19kaG1xbThpZmM4cW90b244cjhhczBoZ3Zmb0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) to see if any other groups are planning events around your chosen date, events can overlap, but if we can avoid it we try to do so.

Below is then a check list of things you will need to organize for the event. You can track your event on our [GitHub project board](https://trello.com/b/6ugXFBTM/pyladies-berlin) by opening an issue on the repository [community-organisation](https://github.com/PyLadiesBerlin/community-organisation) using the template for events.

## Getting support to facilitate your event

As well as the tasks listed above you may also need help on the day, that could be to welcome people at registration, be coaches, watch for comments or questions during an online event or for general support because let's face it, its just more fun to do these things together. ðŸ¤—

Once you have an idea for an event you can post in the discord channel [#organization](https://discord.com/channels/1233348357372772393/1240985831091605595). You can also join our [monthly organizer meeting](monthly-org-meetings) and add your point to the agenda to ask for support there.

If you are looking for coaches then you can post directly in the channel [#coaches](https://discord.com/channels/1233348357372772393/1240987094944579626).

(finding-a-host)=
## Finding a host

We have many hosts reaching out to us by email, we ask them to fill in the following [form](https://forms.gle/mTkQXXaNpp25f3oS6), this allows us to collect all the required information to pair them with an event. The collected information can be found in our [google drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15N5kAJcsTmwtalY0JsbH_hwjLrFpSh5JeV-uXF3b3-A/edit#gid=1904672576) (note you will need to be part of our [google group](google-group) to access this) We try to contact them 1-2 months before the event to book the date, you can use the following [template](host-confirmation-email) to reach out to them. If companies are wondering what hosting involves you can point them to the information in this [repository](./hosting_and_sponsorship.md) and ask them to fill in the form linked before.

When choosing a host how many participants they can accommodate is often the deciding factor. Some location might also be able to sponsor food, childcare or have other factors that match the requirements of your event. In return for hosting we offer companies a 5-10 minute speaker spot at the start of the meetup and thank them on our socials. In the future we also want to add them to our website.

One week before the event we recommend sending the following [follow up email](host-follow-up-email) to ensure everything is ready ahead of the event.

(finding-speakers)=
## Finding speakers

We usually ask community members directly to give talks and also have some that reach out to us by email. We ask potential speakers to fill in the following [form](https://forms.gle/K7qGPhzkuAfNmuWNA), this allows us to collect all the required information to announce the event. You can check if we have any speakers in the resulting [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15N5kAJcsTmwtalY0JsbH_hwjLrFpSh5JeV-uXF3b3-A/edit#gid=502229920) (note that to access this you will need to be part of our [google group](google-group)).

Once you have a date for the event you can send an email (or slack message) to the speaker inviting them to the meetup and setting up a dry run (if requested), the [following template email](speaker-invitation-email) should help you.

Around one week before the event we recommend sending this [follow up email](speaker-follow-up-email) to check the speaker is ready for the event (this can also be a chance to set up a dry run through if one was requested and it has not happened yet)


## Setting up the meetup event

We run our events via Meetup.com. To be able to create an event you will need to be made an organizer in the group, you can [email](mailto:info@jn.contact) us to request this. The text of a draft event and some tips can be found [here](meetup-template).

If you have used the two forms for hosts and speakers you should have all the information required to fill in the meetup page. The page can also be updated later so if some details are missing it is fine to announce the event as it is and later add missing details.

If you still have further questions about how best to run your event, don't hesitate to send us an [email](emailto:info@jn.contact)

(supporting-a-dry-run)=
## Supporting a dry run

Dry runs are an opportunity for our community members to get feedback on their talks/workshops in a safe space before giving them in front of the community. We aim to offer all speakers this chance to present their material in a smaller group and receive constructive feedback. Ideally dry runs will happen with all the speakers for the event present, this way the speakers can also support each other with feedback and it reduces the number of sessions required. If you are organizing a dry run you can also ask for a couple of volunteers to attend the rehearsal session from the [#organisation](https://discord.com/channels/1233348357372772393/1240985831091605595) discord channel.

When you are reviewing a talk make notes as the speaker gives their presentation, though also remember to give the speaker visual cues that you are listening. You should also time the speaker, we are not strict on the length but if the speaker plans to give the talk at a conference keeping the talk within the time limit will be important. Here is a list of things you might think about or consider so you can give feedback.

- Can you determine who the audience is from the presentation, if not how could the speaker make this more clear
- Did the speaker introduce themselves and add a way either at the start or end how the audience can follow them
- What was the top take away for the audience, did the speaker highlight this so it was clear?
- How readable are the slides? examples to look for: amount of text on slides, too much might be distracting, any code needs to be in a large enough and contrast that it can be easily read
- Did the speaker pace themselves, could they go quicker or slower (generally speaking on the day speakers tend to speak quicker)
- Are there any parts that need extra clarification or expect some domain knowledge, it may be an opportunity to make the talk more accessible to a wider audience if additional domain context can be added
- Could additional diagrams or images help explain some concepts?
