### Meetup

Our meetup is paid for by the PSF. A community member is required to be the main organizer, this may require them to add their credit card details but should not result in them being charged. Other members can be given different roles, which gives them different access rights such as being a co-organizer, event organizer etc In general we are not using these roles strictly, but they may be useful to allow folks to create Meetup events.

### Discord 

The Discord server has a server admin, multiple roles, several channels, and we can also create new ones (which can be later archived) for example to organize specific events.

There is a private channel group called #staff which contains organizers across our region. Even though most content is shared in public channels, this private channel group can be useful for topics with a sensitive subject. If you want to be added please request this in the #organisation channel or raise it at one of our [PyCologne monthly org meetings](monthly-org-meetings).
